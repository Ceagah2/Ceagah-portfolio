export const BioText = `
  My name is Carlos Henrique, and I am originally from Taubaté, a small city in the interior of the State of São Paulo. 
  In my free time, I'm a gamer and amateur speedrunner of Resident Evil 3.
  I've been working as a front-end developer since 2020. I decided to leave college, where I was studying Systems Analysis and Development, 
  in the last period of 2020. This decision was influenced by my entry into the workforce, and I chose to focus on my professional career.
  Before becoming a developer, I worked in commerce and also served as a public servant.
  I came close to becoming a professional chef because I have a great passion for that field. 
  I was on the verge of leaving everything at the time and enrolling in a gastronomy college. 
  It took very little for me not to be here now, sharing my portfolio with you.
